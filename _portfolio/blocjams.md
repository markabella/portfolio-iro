<h4>Summary</h4>
Spotify uses a cool music player to allow users to enjoy music online while browsing their website. Building this type music player and site from scratch allowed me to learn and apply key concepts of frontend development via Bloc's Software Development Track.

<h4>Explanation</h4>
Bloc Jams allowed me to learn while doing. As it was what pieced together, my mentor was able to follow along and check my progress step-by-step. I submitted my progress via GitHub. If I had challenges along the way, he was there to help.

<h4>Problem</h4>
I had learned the fundamentals of frontend development though had not yet used all the concepts together for practical use. This included lessons in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Plus, I had not yet learned other tools used for frontend developments such as jQuery and AngularJS.

<h4>Solution</h4>
Creating the Bloc Jams allowed me use everything I learned about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through practical application. The project furthered my learning by holding my hand through three iterations of the project:
1.	The first run through, Bloc Jams was created using vanilla JavaScript.
2.	The vanilla JavaScript was then refactored using jQuery the second run through.
3.	AngularJS was then used to refactor the entire site the third run through.

<h4>Results</h4>
My skills increased and my understanding of frontend development deepened. It was helpful to piece the music player together in three different ways. I was exposed to many new ideas and working on Bloc Jams allowed me to play with the ideas in a learning environment.

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
Creating Bloc Jams worked to increase my ability as a frontend developer significantly. I understood the how, why, and what is needed to make a frontend project successful. This understanding makes me a valuable asset on any project I work on in the future that involves frontend development.
