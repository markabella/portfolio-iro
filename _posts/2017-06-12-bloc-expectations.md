title: Bloc's Software Development Track

<b>Question: “What do you like doing so much... you would pay to do it?”</b>

If "writing code" is on your list, you’re in luck.

It costs over $20,000 (with financing) to join the Bloc’s Software Developer Track. I’ve just completed my first month. So far it’s been smooth sailing. This week, I plan to complete the Frontend section and move into Backend Development.

I did my research before jumping in so I knew what to expect. You can find over 95% positive reviews from students online. The minority of negative reviews dealt with unmanaged expectations. As with my Amazon purchases, I dove into Bloc’s negative reviews so I could manage my own expectations. Here’s what I kept in mind:

<h3>1. Mastery</h3>
I didn’t expect Bloc to make me a master at Full Stack Development in ONE year. Just like becoming a doctor or lawyer, becoming a software engineer requires a broad understanding. This understanding can then be applied and sharpened in specialized areas. Part of me would like to dig deeper into what I’m learning but I know mastery is developed with layers of experience over time. Plus, what I dig into now may not be needed in the specific career I plan to pursue.

<h3>2. Research</h3>
I didn’t expect Bloc to provide all the resources to learn everything I needed to know. I knew I’d be doing a lot of research outside of Bloc. Those who got the most from Bloc soaked up knowledge from every resource available. I find myself watching multiple YouTube videos from different developers to try and get my head around new concepts. This along with one-on-one mentorship from Bloc has been invaluable.

<h3>3. Love</h3>
I didn’t expect Bloc to make me love programming. I loved it coming in. I love solving problems. I love researching how to solve problems. I love the hours hacking away at a program. Eating away at a program bit by bit. Sometimes the program eats away at me. Just like climbing a mountain or finishing a marathon, programming gives me a high. A sense of accomplishment. Time no longer exists. Other than the monetary cost, there was no way I could lose.

In summary, if you understand what it takes to reach mastery, if you enjoy researching every available resource, and if you have a passion for programming, you too may find smooth sailing a month into Bloc.
